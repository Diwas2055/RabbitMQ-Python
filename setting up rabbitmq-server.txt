-> Setting up rabbitmq-server:- 

    To access RabbitMQ in python or what we call it as “a pure-Python AMQP 0–9–1 client for rabbitMQ”, 
    there is a package(library) called pika which can be installed using pip. But first we need to install “rabbitmq-server” which will run as a system program at backend.

    * Install erlang
    * Install rabbitmq-server
    * Enable rabbitmq-server as system program
    * Start rabbitmq-server at backend
    * Enable rabbitmq management plugin

-> Command List: -
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install erlang
    sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
    sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
    sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
    sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

-> Create an username and password to login to rabbitmq management

    ## user is the username and password is the new password
        sudo rabbitmqctl add_user user password

    ## giving that user administrative rights
        sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags user administrator

->  Granting administrator permissions to the user     
        sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / user "." "." "."

->  Listing all the users
        sudo rabbitmqctl list_users
        sudo rabbitmqctl list_permissions -p /

->  Updating Tag of the user
    
    => Tags that can be used:-
        -> administrator
        -> impersonator
        -> management
        -> monitoring
        -> policymaker

        sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags "john.doe" management

->  To check the status of rabbitmq-server
        sudo systemctl status rabbitmq-server

->  Listing queues
        sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues

->  Listing exchanges
        sudo rabbitmqctl list_exchanges

->  Forgotten acknowledgment   
        sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
