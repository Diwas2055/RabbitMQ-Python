# Topic exchange

-> Topic exchange is powerful and can behave like other exchanges.

-> When a queue is bound with "#" (hash) binding key - it will receive all the messages, regardless of the routing key - like in fanout exchange.

-> When special characters "*" (star) and "#" (hash) aren't used in bindings, the topic exchange will behave just like a direct one.
