# Introduction:

    ->  It is a message broker that allows you to send and receive messages between different applications.
    ->  It is a advanced messaging queuing protocol.
    ->  It is a open source and is available for free.

# Language: Python, Java , COBOL , PHP , Ruby , Node.Js

# Basic Components:

( i ) Producer / Publisher :-

    -> The producer / publisher is the application that sends messages to the message broker.
    -> Message is sent to the message broker by the producer.
    -> The producer creates a Routing Key for the message.   
    -> credentials- In this we will define the username and password which is known by the rabbitmq-server(refer installation segment above)
    -> host- by default we use ‘localhost’ or 0.0.0.0 as the listening server, but it can have any other IP addresses on cloud that has rabbitmq-server listening
    -> port- this is by default 5672, but it should point to the port where our server is listening
    -> exchange- this can be assumed as a bridge name which needed to be declared so that queues can be accessed
    -> routing_key- this is a binding key corresponding to that key, we can set it to be any name
    -> basic_publish- this is the method which we call to send the message to the corresponding queue 

( ii ) Consumer :- 

    ->  Each consumer is associated with a queue.
    ->  Each queue has a binding key.
    ->  The consumer consumes the message from the queue.
    ->  Consumer acknowledges the message and the message is then removed from the queue.

( iii ) Routing and Binding Keys :- 

    -> Routing Keys are defined by the publisher / producer.
    -> Binding Keys are used to bind the consumer to the queue.
    -> Words in the Routing and Binding Keys are separated by periods '.'
    -> Routing and Binding Keys are used to discern which message is sent to which consumer.

( iv ) Exchange :- 

    -> the exchange manages which message is sent to which queue
    -> Uses the binding key from the producer / publisher and the 
    -> Producer / Publisher sends the message to the exchange but never directly to the queue.
    -> There are several methods the exchange uses in order to choose which queue to send the message to.

( v ) Exchange Methods

-> Fanout :- 

    -> Fanout exchange is used when the producer / publisher sends the message to the exchange.
    -> The message is sent to all the queues.
    -> The message is not routed to the queue. 

-> Direct :- 

    -> Direct exchange is used when the producer / publisher sends the message directly to the queue.
    -> The message is sent to the queue directly.
    -> The message is not routed to the queue.
    -> If the Routing Key matches the Binding Key of the queue, the message is sent to the queue.

-> Topic :- 

    -> Topic exchange is used when the producer / publisher sends the message to the exchange.
    -> * will match one or more words in the Routing Key.
    -> # will match zero or more words in the Routing Key.
    -> python.* will match python.all but not python.
    -> python.# will match python.all and also python.

-> Default :- 

    -> Also Known as nameless exchange.
    -> The Binding Key from the consumer queue is ignored.
    -> Instead if the Routing Key from the producer / publisher matches the queue name then the message
       is sent to the queue.
    -> If Routing Key is match with queue name.
